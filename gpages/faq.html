						<ul class="clearfix ">
							<li class="column col_6 mb4">
								<h3 class="m-b">How do you charge?</h3>
								<p>While no particular method seems to be perfect, especially with the case of unstructured addressing system in developing markets, we have found that grouping the country and cities into zones has worked very well.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="column col_6 mb4">
								<h3 class="m-b">I run a business and the pricing isn't a good fit.</h3>
								<p>Like we said answered above, our pricing is very fair but if you run a business with high volumes of deliveries weekly, please do contact us at <a href="mailto:finance@meeslogistics.com">finance@meeslogistics.com</a> and we are happy to discuss a price that works for your business.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul class="clearfix">
							<li class="column col_6 mb2">
								<h3 class="m-b">How do I know what size category my item fit?</h3>
								<p>We try to define sizes in the simplest terms that everyone understands, mostly relative to the vehicle required. The other alternative would be to use a scale to determine the weight especially for nationwide and international shipping.</p>
								<p class="pt1 m-b"><strong>SMALL ITEMS:</strong> Food packs, envelopes, small parcels &amp; wraps.</p>
								<p class="m-b"><strong>MEDIUM ITEMS:</strong> Shoe boxes, bags, containers (5ltr size).</p>
								<p><strong>LARGE ITEMS:</strong> Microwaves, Fridge, Large bags e.t.c.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="column col_6 mb2">
								<h3 class="m-b">Do you collect Payment on Delivery (POD)?</h3>
								<p>Yes, we do. POD in this context refers strictly to our drivers collecting money on your behalf at dropoff and <strong>NOT</strong> delivery fees at pickup. We pay out next day. All records of cash colected are available on your dashboard.</p>
