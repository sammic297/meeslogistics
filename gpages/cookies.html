IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES, DO NOT USE THIS SITE. &#8203;</p><h2>What is a cookie?</h2><p>A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers.</p><p>Most websites you visit use cookies to improve your user experience by allowing the website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).</p><p>Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).</p><h2>What do cookies do?</h2><p>Cookies have lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site, for example, even after you “log in,” if you move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.</p><h2>How does Mee's Logistics use cookies?</h2><p> Mee's uses different types of cookies to enhance and improve your experience. Mee's uses cookies for:</p><div class="mb4"><h3>Security</h3><p>We use cookies to enable and support our security features, for example: to authenticate Members, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect Member data from unauthorized parties.</p><h3>Preferences</h3><p>When you are signed in to your account, cookies help us display the correct information and personalize your experience, by providing you with features, insights, and customized content. They can also help you fill out forms more easily, e.g., RFI forms.</p><p>Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the Site experience less functional, but should not prevent it from working.</p><h3>Session State</h3><p>We collect information about how our Users and Members use and interact with the Site. This may include the pages Members visit most often and when and where Members get error messages. We use these “session state cookies” to help us improve our Site and Services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not prevent the Site from working.</p><h3>Analytics</h3><p>These cookies help us learn how our Site performs in different locations. We use cookies to understand and improve our Services and features.</p></div><h2>What should you do if you don’t want cookies to be set?</h2><p>Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile device to be intrusive, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without them knowing. Although cookies are generally quite harmless, you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests using your browser history. If you prefer, you may choose to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set; but you should be aware that you might lose some functions of the website.</p><p>If you want to restrict or block the cookies that are set by our Site, or any other site, you can do so through your browser setting. The ‘Help’ function in your browser should explain how. Alternatively, you can visit www.aboutcookies.org, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will find general information about cookies and details on how to delete cookies from your devices.</p></div></div></section>
